Mathematical Expectation is an important concept in Probability Theory. 
Mathematically, for a discrete variable X with probability function P(X), the expected value E[X] is given by (Σxi * P(xi)).
Example, for a dice-throw experiment, the set of discrete outcomes is { 1,2,3,4,5,6} and each of this outcome has the same probability 1/6. 
Hence, the expected value of this experiment will be 1/6*(1+2+3+4+5+6) = 21/6 = 3.5. 

For a continuous variable X with probability density function P(x) , the expected value E[X] is given by (∫x * P(x)dx). 

It is important to understand that "expected value" is not same as "most probable value" - rather, it need not even be one of the probable 
values. For example, in a dice-throw experiment, the expected value, viz 3.5 is not one of the possible outcomes at all.

The rule of "linearity of of the expectation" says that E[x1+x2] = E[x1] + E[x2].


Problems 1. What is the expected number of coin flips for getting a head?
Ans:

Let the expected number of coin flips be x. Then we can write an equation for it -
a. If the first flip is the head, then we are done. The probability of this event is 1/2 and the number of coin flips for this event is 1.
b. If the first flip is the tails, then we have wasted one flip. Since consecutive flips are independent events, the solution in this
case can be recursively framed in terms of x - The probability of this event is 1/2 and the expected number of coins flips now onwards 
is x. But we have already wasted one flip, so the total number of flips is x+1.
The expected value x is the sum of the expected values of these two cases. Using the rule of linerairty of the expectation and the definition of Expected value, we get
x = (1/2)(1) + (1/2) (1+x)
Solving, we get x = 2.

Thus the expected number of coin flips for getting a head is 2.
